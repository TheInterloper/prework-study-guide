# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project was the first step in my future coding career. It has provided a brief introduction to three different coding languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has also provided exposure to using the terminal to navigate folders locally as well as interfacing with GitHub remotely.
The webpage that was created serves a dual purpose. It allows for the exposure to the coding itself and it serves as a place to put my notes for things I learned in the process of building the page. It is sorted into categories based on each coding language.
During the development of this site I discovered that I will need to improve my typing ability if I want to increase my efficiency in writing code.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

## Usage

The four sections of the webpage simply contain notes on each of the four topics covered in the prework assignment. Be sure to use the devtools to see the JS in action.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
