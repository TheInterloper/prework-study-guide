# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project was the first step in my future coding career. It has provided a brief introduction to three different coding languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has also provided exposure to using the terminal to navigate folders locally as well as interfacing with GitHub remotely.
The webpage that was created serves a dual purpose. It allows for the exposure to the coding itself and it serves as a place to put my notes for things I learned in the process of building the page. It is sorted into categories based on each coding language.
During the development of this site I discovered that I will need to improve my typing ability if I want to increase my efficiency in writing code.

## Installation

## Usage

The four sections of the webpage simply contain notes on each of the four topics covered in the prework assignment. Be sure to use the devtools to see the JS in action.
